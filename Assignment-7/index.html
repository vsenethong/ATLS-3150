  <!-- Task #1 -->

  <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

  This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.

  <h2>The Llama</h2>

  Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.

  <h2>The Anaconda</h2>

  The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
